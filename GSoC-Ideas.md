# Ideas for Google Summer of Code projects

Interested in working with CHAOSS? Below are some project ideas. We describe how to apply to work with CHAOSS and how we select students on a different page: https://github.com/chaoss/governance/blob/master/GSoC-interest.md

**[CHAOSS FOLK: Please see our 2021 Document for Examples](./GSoC-ideas-2021.md)**

----

## Idea: Provide a Title that Succinctly Summarizes the Idea

[Micro-tasks and place for questions]`(  )` **In the parentheses, provide a link to an issue open for answering questions** 

```
One paragraph description. Perhaps two. (coding ticks provided only for emphasis. Remove before submitting PR.)
```

The aims of the project are as follows:
  - X
  - Y
  - Q

```
Describe the programming Skills necessary, and those a potential student should be willing to learn. (coding ticks provided only for emphasis. Remove before submitting PR.)
```

* _Difficulty:_ Low, Medium, High (or other classification of your choosing)
* _Requirements:_ These can be technical or analytical. 
* _Recommended:_ Aimed at "things you have done before, at least in class."
* _Mentors:_ Last year 2 mentors were required per project. Waiting for site to open for this year. 


## Each Subsequent Idea gets a new heading like this

# Ideas for Google Summer of Code projects

Interested in working with CHAOSS? Below are some project ideas. We describe how to apply to work with CHAOSS and how we select students on a different page: https://github.com/chaoss/governance/blob/master/GSoC-interest.md

**[CHAOSS FOLK: Please see our 2021 Document for Examples](./GSoC-Ideas-2021.md)**

----

## Idea: Provide a Title that Succinctly Summarizes the Idea

[Micro-tasks and place for questions]`(  )` **In the parentheses, provide a link to an issue open for answering questions**

```
One paragraph description. Perhaps two. (coding ticks provided only for emphasis. Remove before submitting PR.)
```

The aims of the project are as follows:
  - X
  - Y
  - Q

```
Describe the programming Skills necessary, and those a potential student should be willing to learn. (coding ticks provided only for emphasis. Remove before submitting PR.)
```

* _Difficulty:_ Low, Medium, High (or other classification of your choosing)
* _Requirements:_ These can be technical or analytical. 
* _Recommended:_ Aimed at "things you have done before, at least in class."
* _Mentors:_ Last year 2 mentors were required per project. Waiting for GSoC site to open for this year.

## Each Subsequent Idea gets a new heading like this

## Idea: Improve the CHAOSS DEI Event Badging Review Bot

[Micro-tasks and place for questions](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/issues/134)

  The CHAOSS DEI Badging Initiative has been providing badges to event organizers who implement valid DEI practices into their events. The badge is used as a reward system for events with inclusive and welcoming environments. In each review, the Badging Initiative uses a badging-bot to automate some of the processes that help an applicant earn their event badge.
  The idea of this mentorship is to learn about CHAOSS DEI Badging and its badging bot, then improve the processes and operation of the badging-bot. This may include working on learning the existing code as well as with algorithms and cross-file references in Javascript. The GSoC student may also be expected to deploy the improvements to the bot on GitHub.

The aims of the project are as follows:
  - Clean up and document current badging-bot code and processes
  - Migrate the badging-bot to a new platform
  - Time permitting, integrate a reviewer assignment algorithm

The applicant must be prepared to work with existing code to improve a GitHub app and integrate that app into the repositories for the CHAOSS Badging Initiative

* _Difficulty:_ Medium
* _Requirements:_ Appreciates DEI, Working knowledge of JavaScript, Experience with GitHub Apps
* _Recommended:_ Experience with webhooks, Experience creating documentation
* _Mentors:_ Needed (prev. Matt Cantu Snell)
